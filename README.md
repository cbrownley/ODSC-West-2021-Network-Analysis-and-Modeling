## [Visualizing and Analyzing Networks with Python or R (and Javascript)](https://odsc.com/speakers/visualizing-and-analyzing-networks-with-python-or-r-and-javascript/)

**Abstract**:

Social networks play a powerful role in shaping our lives, affecting our power and influence, how we acquire and think about basic facts, as well as our behaviors. These effects exist in our professional environments as much as they do in our personal lives. Given the importance of these social structures on our personal and professional lives, it’s incredibly valuable to be able to visualize and analyze them because this knowledge enables you to drive positive change.

By completing this tutorial, you will develop an understanding of some basic properties of social networks, including how to calculate network statistics, how to visualize networks, and how to incorporate network characteristics into your statistical models. You will become familiar with how to compute network statistics and perform statistical modeling in Python or R, as well as how to create interactive visualizations of networks in Javascript.

**Session Outline**:

*Lesson 1*: Network Elements and Characteristics

Familiarize yourself with network elements and characteristics and the Python or R syntax necessary to compute these statistics. At the end of this lesson, you will be able to describe different network types and generate some key network statistics in Python or R.

*Lesson 2*: Visualizing Networks

Familiarize yourself with common network visualizations and how to generate interactive versions of them in Javascript. At the end of this lesson, you will be able to describe the strengths and weaknesses of different network visualizations and generate interactive network visualizations in Javascript.

*Lesson 3*: Modeling Network Characteristics and Outcomes

Let’s answer some intriguing business questions by using our network data! We’ll put our modeling skills to the test to analyze the relationship between our network characteristics and outcomes of interest. At the end of this lesson, you will be able to generate statistical models that incorporate network data to predict outcomes.
